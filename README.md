# SNAP
Playing with D3 snap to grid

Also playing with [`gulp`](https://gulpjs.com/) to watch the [`scss`](http://sass-lang.com/) and `es6` files and compile them into `css` and `js` files respectively. Lots of fun really!

This was done with lots of watchers. The `.gitignore` file has removed the `node_modules` folder but running `npm install` should get everything up and running for you.

Excuse the dodgy maths madness ;-)
